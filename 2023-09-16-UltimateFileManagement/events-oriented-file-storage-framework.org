Every day, as I create, receive or update a lot of files (like notes,
blogs, papers, books, assets, slides, git repositories, experimental
codes, and various other types), I find myself pondering the
possibility of having a cohesive method to store, access, and back
them up.

After years of thinking and trying, I guess it is time to settle down
my framework of /storing/ files. This framework aims to be simple and
clean, and serve as a solid foundation for scripting access and backup
functionalities that meet my specific requirements..

** Organize files into events

The central idea of this file storage framework is organizing files
into different /events/. As I described in [[../2023-04-09-ManageFiles/notes.org][this post]], an event is simple
a folder with name pattern =YYYY-mm-dd-BriefName/=.  Almost all my files
are placed in =~/Documents/= folder, under which I put all my event
folders.

When I review or share my works, event is the smallest unit.

Before elaborating on reasons why I choose this /event/-oriented
approach, let me first discuss two approaches that I tried but gave up
eventually.

*** Groupping files into categories is not I want

The first approach I tried is /category/-oriented. It is not surprised,
since we all have those pre-created folders named /Documents/, /Videos/,
/Musics/ etc. To better classifying my files, I created new folders
named /References/, /Slides/, /Codes/, /Subjects/, and later on more specific
folders such as /Manuscripts/, /Notes/, /Templates/, /Plugins/.

Some of those folders work well, like /Musics/, /Books/ and /Plugins/.  They
are well defined and I am very confident on whether a new file or
folder should be placed inside them and whether some file or folder I
am looking for will be there. However, some folders quickly become too
deep and their positions overlap with other folders. For example, the
/Subjects/ folder is created with subfolders named /Math/, /Physics/ and /CS/,
and each subfolder contains course subsubfolders like
/RealAnalysis/, /Probability/ and /Mechanics/.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Subjects/
├── CS/
├── Math/
│   ├── Probability/
│   └── RealAnalysis/
└── Physics/
    └── Mechanics/
#+END_EXAMPLE

Looks like neatly organized, right? But when it comes to practice, it
is a totally different story. Imagine that I attend one lecture of
probability, downloaded professor's slide and the homework. After
several days of self-studying, I probably finished the homework and
wrote a small note on what I had learnt. Now, how do I deal with those
files?

If I insist on organizing files according to their categories, the
slide and note should be placed in the top level /Slides/ folder and
/Notes/ folder respectively. It seems that only the homework will be
placed in the /Probability/ folder, which is clearly not a folder meant
for homeworks however.  Moreover, when I move that slide into the
/Slides/ folder, should I follow the original hierarchy like
=Slides/Math/Probability/=? Should I also move that note into
=Notes/Math/Probability/=?  What if I also wrote some experimental
code?

Manually enforcing that a file should be placed inside a certain
category folder is boring. Doing so also breaks the connection between
a group of files. In this scenario, these files are produced within a
small period of time and have strong connections to each other. In
addition, storing them in different folders is a bad idea for
synchronization. Imagine that I have to switch between different
machines during writing my note and that homework. Comparing with a
single folder, storing in several folders with complex hierarchy
structures is clearly more troublesome.

There are also other problems with this category-oriented approach,
like the inefficiency introduced by very deep folder structures, and
unbalanced folder sizes.

While I may continue to use folders like /Musics/, /Videos/ and /Books/, I
will certainly not continue to create new top level folders and
enforce that any file matching a category should be placed inside the
corresponding top level folder.

*** Tagging every file is not I want

After the failure of category-based approach, I was still looking for
a way to organize my files in a logical structure.  Soon or later, I
realized that one of the crucial drawbacks of the previous approach is
the exclusive nature of categories, i.e., a file must belong to one
category (one top-level folder) or another one, but not both.

Indeed, it is quite natural to think a file can only sit in one place
on the disk. However, in terms of the various attributes of a
particular file, we may want to find it in different locations. Take
the example mentioned before of attending a lecture. It would be very
natural to assume the note should appear in both
=Notes/Math/Probability/= and =Subjects/Math/Probability/=.  When I am
looking for a slide, I may consult the top-level folder /Slides/. When I
am looking for all staffs related to a particular subject, I may
consult the top-level folder /Subjects/.

Following this line of thinking, I then realized that the (sub)folder
name acts like tags. A file in =Notes/Math/Probability/= are expected to
have tags /Notes/, /Math/ and /Probability/. In this point of view, the
deep hierarchy structure is actually not important. It is meaningless
to differentiate between folder =Notes/Math/Probability/= and folder
=Math/Probability/Notes/=.

Then I imagined a tag-based approach of organizing files. A file may
have arbitrary tags, e.g., =tagA, tagB, tagC=.  For each tag, I create a
top-level folder with the same name. The true location of a file does
not matter. I can put it at anywhere. However, as long as I give a tag
to the file, I will create a symbolic link of this file in the
corresponding tag folder. Then it is not hard to write a small script
which can list all files having a particular collection of tags.

Of course, there are other ways of implementing a tag-based file
system. Besides the way of symbolic links, one can also use

1. hard links;
2. database, keeping records of file paths and their tags;
3. special name convention, similar to database, but tags are
   embedded in the file name.

Well, this approach sounds very nice theoretically too.  But I never
seriously try it in practice.

1. It is actually a framework of file access, not file storage.  It
   does not answer how to organize files in the disk.  Indeed, all
   current file systems are tree/folder based, not tag based.

2. Too sophisticated to maintain. Links in tag folders, database and
   special words in filenames are all too complicated to manipulate.

3. Tagging every file is tedious, especially since the need to search
   by tags doesn't arise frequently.

I want a simple solution to /store/ my files. Assigning tags to files
might be useful for viewing and searching, but does not solve my
problem. For special type of files, like books and notes, I may try to
manage them by tags, but I will not try to put every file in this
framework.

*** Event directory is all I need

In practice, after I abandoned those category folders, I went to the
event-oriented approach to organize files. Actually, I adopted this
approach even before I notice the concept of event directory.  At the
beginning, I simply put all files I need for a particular task in a
separate folder. Then I had so many those folders and I decided to add
a date prefix to sort them antichronologically. That's it. I found
myself so comfortable with this file structure.

1. /Self-contained./ An event folder contains all files I need to work
   on this task. I can work on it without boring myself on other
   folders most of the time.  When I switch machines, I need only to
   ensure this event folder is synchronized, without wasting time on
   syncing unnecessary files.

2. /Flexible./ I can put anything inside an event folder and organize
   them in the way I like. For example, I can put pictures required by
   a latex manuscript, a git repo to track some experimental scripts,
   some assets collected from the internet, etc. In fact, I just treat
   an event folder as the workspace for it and put any necessary files
   in it.

3. /Flat strcture./ All even folders are placed in the same level.  No
   intermediate folders like =2023/= or =2024/=. Flat structure is more
   efficient to browse and work with. Moreover, by prepending date,
   all folders are neatly sorted. Events in the same month come to
   close by default, both in file explorer and terminal output of =ls=.
   Adding intermediate folders is meaningless.

4. /Archive automatically./ Thanks to the nature of self-containing,
   moving old event folders to other place does not influence my
   workflow.  In parctice, most event folders are rarely needed after
   a short period of time. Though from time to time I may want to
   review what I have done in the past month, I rarely visit an event
   folder created years ago. Even when I want to visit, I typically do
   not want to change the content. This fact make it very convenient
   to archive event folders and backup them. At any time, the number
   of event folders I need pay attention to is generally not larger
   than 20.

** Further discussion on the event-oriented approach

Now I summarize some properties of an event folder should have.

1. Its name starts with a date string in the format =YYYY-mm-dd-= and
   ends with the event name.

2. It should be self-contained and include necessary staffs for
   working on.

Below I want to add two more properties:

3. [@3] It should occupied less than 500MB disk space.
4. All files with base name =notes= are reserved for storing metadata of
   the event. (This rule does not apply to subfolders in the event
   directory.)

*** Share assets between events

The second property is crucial but sometimes can be troublesome.  For
example, if an event involves working with a lot of large immutable
assets, like a lot of data files or a lot of pictures, the event
folder might grow too large, say larger than 4GB.  In addition, if
there is another event involves working with the same assets, copying
them to the new folder does not seem to be a good idea.

My resolution is creating another top-level folder, say =~/Assets/=,
which acts like a repo for large files. For example, if an event
involves accessing to the famous MNIST dataset, I can move the dataset
to folder =~/Assets/MNIST/= and leave a symbolic link in the event
folder. The folder =~/Assets/= is also a good place to store data
outputs, like model weights of neural networks.

The folder =~/Assets/= is synced across machines.  In order to avoid
name conflict, I often add the same date prefix when allocating new
asset folders.

*** Write a descriptive journal for each event

I always create a =notes.org= in each event folder, which serves like a
private README and journal for this event whose audience is future
myself.

Generally, I add meta data of the event in the front matter,including
/TITLE/ and /DATE/. In [[../2024-01-14-TryOrgPublish/notes.org][this post]], I introduced how I use =org-publish= to
generate a sitemap of all events based on those notes files. In the
near future, I may add the /KEYWORDS/ field for searching. The body may
contain journal of working on the event, links to useful resources and
anything I want to write down. In general, this file can possibly
contain descriptions to

1. metadata of the event, like tags, title, date and so on;
2. purpose and state of the event, like in what circumstance I create it and what is going on;
3. git repos related to the event;
4. notes/blogs related to the event;
5. papers/books related to the event;
6. assets related to the event, like resources, large files and so on;
7. file/folder structure of the event; represented as org entries, possibly tagged;

Different from the README file of a git repo, =notes.org= is always
private and never gets public. If I want to publish some content of it
to my blog, I just create a new post, cut and paste from it and leave
a link in the notes which looks like /see my post here/.

*** Generate an index page listing all events

One advantage of adopting the event-oriented framework is the
convenient reviewing experience. As all event directories follows a
particular naming pattern and has a descriptive journal =notes.org=, it
is not hard to recognize all these journals and create an index page;
see the figure.

[[./demo-index.png]]

Clicking an event in this index page leads to its journal =notes.html=,
which can give me a quick review about what I have done.

See my post [[https://dou-meishi.github.io/org-blog/2024-01-14-TryOrgPublish/notes.html][Review org-publish Utility]] for how I create this index
page via emacs org-publish utility.

*** How to transform a folder to an event folder

Given an existed folder =dirname/=, I go through these steps to transform
it into an event folder.

1. Normalize its name to ensure it matches the format =YYYY-mm-dd-EventName=.
   Here the date may be inferred from the folder content.

2. Normalize the journal file =notes.org=. Ensure there are two metadata
   entry =#+TITLE= and =#+DATE=. The latter is recommended to be
   consistent with the folder name, but not strictly required.

   In addition, check the content of =notes.org=. Ensure it can remind
   me of the purpose of this folder.

3. Normalize the folder size to be smaller than 500MB.  If not,
   reorganize files inside this folder and move large assets to
   =~/Assets/=.

*** Tips

1. This approach may not be suitable to organize context-free assets.

   However, for me, most assets have context. For example, books on probability theory
   are most refered in writing notes of the subject. So these books are placed in the
   same event directory as these notes.

2. Create a new event and refer to the old event, instead of enlarge the old event folder.

   Remember to briefly conclude what you obtained from the old event.
