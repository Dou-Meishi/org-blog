Every day, as I create, receive or update a lot of files (like notes,
blogs, papers, books, assets, slides, git repositories, experimental
codes, and various other types), I find myself pondering the
possibility of having a cohesive method to store, access, and back
them up.
</p>

<p>
After years of thinking and trying, I guess it is time to settle down
my framework of <i>storing</i> files. This framework aims to be simple and
clean, and serve as a solid foundation for scripting access and backup
functionalities that meet my specific requirements..
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org152b633" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org152b633">Organize files into events</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org152b633">
<p>
The central idea of this file storage framework is organizing files
into different <i>events</i>. As I described in <a href="../2023-04-09-ManageFiles/notes.html">this post</a>, an event is simple
a folder with name pattern <code>YYYY-mm-dd-BriefName/</code>.
</p>

<p>
Before elaborating on reasons why I choose this <i>event</i>-oriented
approach, let me first discuss two approaches that I tried but gave up
eventually.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org81291e9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org81291e9">Groupping files into categories is not I want</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org81291e9">
<p>
The first approach I tried is <i>category</i>-oriented. It is not surprised,
since we all have those pre-created folders named <i>Documents</i>, <i>Videos</i>,
<i>Musics</i> etc. To better classifying my files, I created new folders
named <i>References</i>, <i>Slides</i>, <i>Codes</i>, <i>Subjects</i>, and later on more specific
folders such as <i>Manuscripts</i>, <i>Notes</i>, <i>Templates</i>, <i>Plugins</i>.
</p>

<p>
Some of those folders work well, like <i>Musics</i>, <i>Books</i> and <i>Plugins</i>.  They
are well defined and I am very confident on whether a new file or
folder should be placed inside them and whether some file or folder I
am looking for will be there. However, some folders quickly become too
deep and their positions overlap with other folders. For example, the
<i>Subjects</i> folder is created with subfolders named <i>Math</i>, <i>Physics</i> and <i>CS</i>,
and each subfolder contains course subsubfolders like
<i>RealAnalysis</i>, <i>Probability</i> and <i>Mechanics</i>.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org110ed0a">
Subjects/
├── CS/
├── Math/
│   ├── Probability/
│   └── RealAnalysis/
└── Physics/
    └── Mechanics/
</pre>

<p>
Looks like neatly organized, right? But when it comes to practice, it
is a totally different story. Imagine I have attend one lecture of
probability, downloaded professor's slide and the homework. After
several days of self-studying, I probably finished the homework and
wrote a small note on what I had learnt. Now, how do I deal with those
files?
</p>

<p>
If I insist on organizing files according to their categories, the
slide and note should be placed in the top level <i>Slides</i> folder and
<i>Notes</i> folder respectively. It seems that only the homework will be
placed in the <i>Probability</i> folder, which is clearly not a folder meant
for homeworks however.  Moreover, when I move that slide into the
<i>Slides</i> folder, should I follow the oroginal hierarchy like
<code>Slides/Math/Probability/</code>? Should I also move that note into
<code>Notes/Math/Probability/</code>?  What if I also wrote some experimental
code?
</p>

<p>
Manually enforcing that a file should be placed inside a certain
category folder is boring and also breaks the connection between a
group of files. In this scenario, these files are produced within a
small period of time and have strong connections to each other. In
addition, storing them in different folders is a bad idea for
synchronization. Imagine that I have to switch between different
machines during writing my note and that homework. Comparing with a
single folder, storing in several folders with complex hierarchy
structures is clearly more troublesome.
</p>

<p>
There are also other problems with this category-oriented approach,
like the inefficiency introduced by very deep folder structures, and
unbalanced folder sizes.
</p>

<p>
While I can continue to use <i>Musics</i>, <i>Videos</i> and <i>Books</i>, I will certainly
not continue to create new top level folders and enforce that any file
matching a category should be placed inside the corresponding top
level folder.
