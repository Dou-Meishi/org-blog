By Bolzano-Weierstrass’ theorem, we know that any bounded sequence of
real values has a convergent subsequence. This result can be extended
to finite dimensional space, i.e, any bounded sequence in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ has a convergent subsequence. However, it is not true
in infinite dimensional space, say,
$\mathbb{R}^{[0,1]}$. Nevertheless, there are two well-known theorem
to establish the convergence of a sequence of functions, the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arzel%C3%A0%E2%80%93Ascoli_theorem][Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helly%27s_selection_theorem][Helly's selection theorem]]. The main
difference between these two results is the notion of convergence of a
function sequence. Arzelà–Ascoli theorem deals with the uniformly
convergence and Helly's selection theorem deals with the pointwise
convergence.

** Statement

/Lemma (Helly)./ Suppose that $\{f_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a /uniformly
bounded/ sequence of /increasing/ functions on an interval. Then there is
a subsequence converging /pointwise/ to an increasing function.

In probability theory, this theorem is often stated in the following manner.

/Theorem (Helly)./ For every sequence of $\{F_n\}$ of distribution
functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $[0,1]$, there exists a subsequence
$\{F_{n_k}\}$ and a nondecreasing, right-continuous function $F$ such
that $\lim_k F_{n_k}(x) = F(x)$ at continuity points $x$ of $F$.

/Proof./ The proof is based on the [[./diagonal-argument.jpg][diagonal argument]]. See [[./proof-Helly-by-Billingsley.png][here]] for the
complete proof given in Billingsley's book.

/Remark./ The limiting funciton $F$ may not be a distribution function.
For example, let $F_n(x) = \mathbb{1}(x \geq n)$ be the distribution
function corresponding to a unit mass at $n$. Then the limiting
function $F(x)\equiv0$ is clearly not a distribution function.

/Remark./ The proof of this version can be adapted to prove the original
version. First, it is necessary that $0 \leq F_n \leq 1$ but $F_n$
need not to be a distribution function.  Second, if we do not require
$F$ to be right-continuous, then we can redefine the values of $F$ at
discontinuity points, and select a finer subsequence such that $\lim_k
F_{n_k}(x)=F(x)$ at every $x$.  This is because the set of
discontinuity points of a monotone function is countable.

** Problems

1. Is there a subsequence of $(\sin (x/k))_{k=1}^\infty$ converges pointwise?
2. Is there a subsequence of $(\sin (x+k))_{k=1}^\infty$ converges pointwise?
3. Is there s subsequence of $(\sin (kx))_{k=1}^\infty$ converges pointwise?

Answers to the first two questions are positive, which can be shown
easily by Arzelà–Ascoli theorem. The answer to the last question,
however, is negative; see [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1380286/pointwise-almost-everywhere-convergent-subsequence-of-sin-nx][this discussion]]. Hence, the last
one is a perfect example that shows the monotone condition is
essential in Helly's selection theorem.

** Further discussion

/Pointwise convergence is weaker than uniformly convergence./ In
$\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$, let $e^n=(e^n_k)_{k=1}^\infty$ be the
sequence with all zero entries except the \(n\)-th entry be 1. Then
the sequence $(e^n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is bounded under the sup
norm. Moreover, it converges pointwise to $e^*\equiv0$. However, The
sequence $(e^n)$ is clearly divergent under the sup norm.
Indeed, by the diagonal argument, any uniformly bounded sequence in
$\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ has a subsequence which converges pointwise.
