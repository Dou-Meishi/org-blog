Convolution operations are foundational in deep learning for
extracting features in image tasks. Calculating their gradients is
critical for training convolutional neural networks, enabling
backpropagation to update parameters and minimize loss. This post
derives these gradients through two complementary approaches: direct
differentiation of the convolution definition, and a linear algebra
perspective which naturally introduces the <i>transposed convolution</i>
(also known as <i>deconvolution</i>).

Early this year, I created this blog site and share some well-written
notes on it. Since then, I really enjoy blogging and continue to post
interesting things I learn. Recently, I came across the <a href="https://github.com/giscus/giscus/tree/main">giscus</a>
project, a comment system powered by GitHub Discussions, which allows
me to add a comment section to my posts. It seems to work well on my
site after trying it, so I believe it presents a good opportunity to
enhance this site further and encourage more exchanges of ideas.

People are familiar with vectors and matrices operations but are less
familiar with tensor operations. In machine learning, <i>tensors</i> often
refer to batched vectors or batched matrices and are represented by an
array-like object with multiple indices. Due to this reason, tensors
operations in most Python packages, including NumPy, PyTorch and
TensorFlow, are typically named after vectors and matrices operations.
However, tensors themselves have a particular useful operation, called
<i>contraction</i>, which uses index-based notations and can cover most
vectors and matrices operations. This index-based notations
intuitively and verbosely describe the relationship between the
components of input and output tensors. Today's topic, the Python's
<a href="https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops">einops</a> package, extends these notations and provides an elegant API
for flexible and powerful tensor operations.

Transformers serve as the backbone of large language models. Just as
 convolutional networks revolutionized image processing, transformers
 have significantly advanced natural language processing since their
 introduction. The efficient parallel computation and transfer
 learning capabilities of transformers have led to the rise of
 <i>pre-trained paradigm</i>. In this approach, a large-scale
 transformer-based model, referred to as the <i>foundation model</i>, is
 trained on a significant volume of data and subsequently utilized for
 downstream tasks through some form of fine-tuning. Our familiar
 friend ChatGPT is such an example, where GPT stands for generative
 pre-trained transformers. Meanwhile, transformer-base models achieve
 state-of-the-art performace for many different modalities, including
 text, image, video, point cloud, and audio data, and have been used
 for both discriminative and generative applications.

Backpropagation and automatic differentiation (AD) are fundamental
components of modern deep learning frameworks. However, many
practitioners pay little attention to their implementations and may
regard them as some sort of "black magic". It indeed looks like magic
that PyTorch can virtually calculate derivatives of an arbitrary
function defined by the user, and even accommodate flow control
elements like conditional execution, which is mathematically not
differentiable. Although we understand that mathematically they
primarily employ the chain rule, it remains unclear how they
efficiently apply it to a function whose form is entirely unknown and
will be determined by the user.
