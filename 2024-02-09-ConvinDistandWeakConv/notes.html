In statistics, we often want to study the asymptotic behavior of
random variables, or in other words, the limit of their
distributions. This concept appears in the central limit theorem which
asserts that the empirical mean of random observations always converges
to a normal distribution, regardless the distribution of the observed
random variable.
</p>

<p>
There are several concepts of the convergence of random variables,
e.g, almost surely convergence, convergence in probability and
convergence in distribution. <i>Convergence in distribution</i> (also called
<i>convergence in law</i>) is the weakest type of convergence among them. It
is actually defined in terms of the pointwise convergence of
distribution functions. Hence, it is also a type of convergence of
probability measures, as there is a one-to-one correspondence between
distribution functions and probability measures. The concept of weak
convergence of probability measures is therefore introduced.
</p>

<p>
Below, we first give the definitions of convergence in distribution of
random variables and weak convergence of probability measures.  Then
the Skorhod's theorem is proved and a direct application of it is
given. Finally, we discuss equivalent characterization of weak
convergence without referring to distribution functions.  The result
is helpful in understanding the weak topology in the space of
probability measures. For complete discussions, please refer to
Billingsley's book and Parthasarathy's book.
</p>

<p>
Random variables mentioned below are all real-valued.  The
distribution function \(F\) of a random variable \(X\) is thereby \(F(x)=
\mathbb{P}(X \leq x)\).  The theory of random variables valued in
\(\mathbb{R}^n\), and or more general in a Polish space, is a bit
complicated and left untouched.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3600215" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3600215">Definitions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3600215">
<p>
<i>Definition.</i> A sequence of real-valued random variables \(\{X_n\}\) (with
distribution functions \(\{F_n\}\)) is said to <i>converge in distribution</i>
or <i>in law</i> to \(X\) (with distribution function \(F\)) if \(F_n(x)\)
converges to \(F(x)\) at continuity points \(x\) of \(F\), i.e., \[\lim_n
F_n(x) = F(x), \quad\text{for every continuity point $x$ of $F$}.\]
</p>

<p>
<i>Remark.</i> In this definition, it is the distribution function which
matters, and there is nothing to do with the underlying probability
space. So, random variables \(\{X_n\}\) may be defined on entirely
different probability space.
</p>

<p>
As we all know, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
distribution functions and probability measures<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.  Therefore, we
can define the convergence of probability measures in the same vain.
</p>

<p>
<i>Definition.</i> A sequence of probability measures \(\{\mu_n\}\) on the real
line is said to <i>converge weakly</i> to a probability measure \(\mu\) if \[
\lim_n \mu_n((-\infty, x]) = \mu((-\infty, x]), \quad \text{for which
$\mu(\{x\}) = 0$}.\]
</p>

<p>
<i>Remark.</i> Like the continuity condition in the definition of convergence
in distributions, here the condition \(\mu(\{x\})=0\) is also essential.
In fact, the set \((\infty, x])\) is called a \(\mu\)-continuity set if
\(\mu(\{x\})=0\). If a set \(A\) is not a \(\mu\)-continuity set, then
\(\lim_n\mu_n(A)\) may fail to converge to \(\mu(A)\).
</p>

<p>
<i>Notation.</i> We write \(X_n ⇒ X\) if \(X_n\) converge in law to \(X\).  In this
case, we may also write \(F_n ⇒ F\).  Similarly, we write \(\mu_n ⇒ \mu\)
if \(\mu_n\) converge weakly to \(\mu\).
</p>

<p>
Obviously, random variables \(X_n\) converge in law to \(X\) if
and only if probability measures \(\mathbb{P}_{ X_n}\) converge weakly
to \(\mathbb{P}_{X}\), i.e.,
\[\lim_n \mathbb{P}_{X_n}((-\infty, x]) =
\mathbb{P}_{X}((-\infty, x]), \quad\text{for every $x$ such that
$\mathbb{P}_X(\{x\})=0$}.\]
</p>

<p>
<i>Example.</i> Let \(\mu_n\) corresponds to a mass of \(1/n\) at each point \(0,
\frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n}, \ldots, \frac{n-1}{n}\). Then it is clear
that \(\mu_n\) converges weakly to \(\mu\), the Lebesgue measure confined
on \([0,1]\).  However, \(\mu_n(\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1])=1\) for all \(n\) but
\(\mu(\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1])=0\).
</p>

<p>
<i>Example.</i> Let \(X_n\equiv a_n\) and \(X\equiv a\). Then
 \(F_n(x)=\mathbb{1}(x\geq a_n)\) and \(F(x)=\mathbb{1}(x\geq a)\).
 Clearly, \(X_n\) converges in distribution to \(X\) if and only if
 \(a_n\to a\). However, if \(a_n > a\) for infinite many \(n\), then
 \(F_n(a)\) fails to converge to \(F(a)\).
</p>

<p>
Finally, we should mention that the limit of convergence in law and
weak convergence is unique. If \(F_n ⇒ F\) and \(F_n ⇒ G\), then
\(F(x)=G(x)\) holds for every \(x\), including their discontinuities.
Indeed, by the definition of weak convergence, \(F\) and \(G\) agree on
the real line except countable points. As \(F\) and \(G\) are right
continuous, they must agree on those countable points. See <a href="./proof-to-uniqueness-of-weak-limit.png">here</a> for a
complete proof.

<h2 id="orga08ac59">Skorohod's theorem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga08ac59">
<p>
For any probability measure \(\mu_n\) on the real line, we can construct
a probability space and a random variable \(Y_n\) on it such that \(Y_n\)
induces \(\mu_n\). For probability measures \(\mu_n ⇒ \mu\), the following
theorem states that \(Y_n\) and \(Y\) can be constructed on the same
probability space, and even in such a way that \(Y_n(\omega) \to
Y(\omega)\) fo every \(\omega\), which is a much stronger condition than
\(Y_n ⇒ Y\).
</p>

<p>
<i>Theorem [Skorohod].</i> Suppose that \(\mu_n ⇒ \mu\). Then there exists a
probability space \((\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})\) and random
variables \(Y_n\) and \(Y\) on it such that \(Y_n\) has distribution
\(\mu_n\), \(Y\) has distribution \(\mu\), and \(Y_n(\omega)\to Y(\omega)\)
for every \(\omega\).
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof.</i> The proof is constructive and based on quantile functions. See
<a href="./proof-Skorohod-theorem.png">here</a> for the complete proof. You may also want to look at <a href="../2024-02-13-QuantileFunction/notes.html">this post</a>
for a brief review of quantile functions. Below is the sketch of
constructing those random variables.
</p>

<p>
Let \(F_n\) and \(F\) be the distribution functions corresponding to
\(\mu_n\) and \(\mu\).  Let \(q_n\) and \(q\) be the corresponding quantile
functions.  Take the probability space on which there exists a random
variable \(U\) which follows the uniform distribution on \((0,1)\). Then
\(q_n(U)\) and \(q(U)\) have distribution \(\mu_n\) and \(\mu\) respectively.
It can be proved that if \(F_n(x)\to F(x)\) at continuity points of \(F\)
then \(q_n(u)\to q(u)\) at continuity points of \(q\). Let
\(N\subset(0,1)\) be the set of discontinuity points of \(q\).
Define
</p>

$$
Y_n(\omega) = \begin{cases}
q_n(U(\omega)),&\quad \omega\not\in N,\\
0,&\quad\omega\in N,
\end{cases}
\quad
Y(\omega) = \begin{cases}
q(U(\omega)),&\quad \omega\not\in N,\\
0,&\quad\omega\in N.
\end{cases}
$$

<p>
Then \(Y_n\) and \(Y\) satisfy the desired properties.

<p>
<i>Corollary 1.</i> If \(X_n ⇒ X\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X \in D_h)=0\), then \(h(X_n)
⇒ h(X)\).  Here, \(D_h\) is the set of discontinuity points of the
measurable function \(h\).
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof.</i> See <a href="./proof-to-corollary1.png">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Corollary 2.</i> If \(X_n ⇒ a\) and \(h\) is continuous at \(a\), then \(h(X_n) ⇒
h(a)\).

<h2 id="orge2db44b">Equivalent definition of weak convergence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge2db44b">
<p>
<i>Definition.</i> A set \(A\) is a \(\mu\)-continuity set if it is a Borel set
and \(\mu(\partial A)=0\).  Here, the boundary \(\partial A\) is the
closure of \(A\) minus its interior.
</p>

<p>
<i>Theorem.</i> The following conditions are equivalent.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(\mu_n ⇒\mu\);</li>
<li>\(\int f\,d\mu_n \to \int f\,d\mu\) for every bounded and continuous
real function \(f\);</li>
<li>\(\int f\,d\mu_n \to \int f\,d\mu\) for every bounded and uniformly
continuous real function \(f\);</li>
<li>\(\mu_n(A)\to \mu(A)\) for every \(\mu\)-continuity set \(A\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Those equivalent statements can be used to define the weak convergence
of probability measures on general Polish spaces, not limited to the
real line. See Parthasarathy's book <i>Probability Measures on Metric
Spaces</i> for a complete discussion
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof.</i> See <a href="./proof-equivalent-definition-weak-convergence.png">here</a>. The basic ideas in the proof are listed below.

Hence, 1) ⇒ 2), 1) ⇒ 3), 1) ⇒ 4).</li>
<li>Then it remains to show 3) ⇒ 1). For any \(x\in\mathbb{R}\) and \(ϵ >
   0\), pick a bounded and uniformly continuous function \(f_ϵ\) such
that \(\mathbb{1}_{(-\infty, x]} \leq f_ϵ \leq \mathbb{1}_{(-\infty,
   x+\epsilon]}\) on the real line (e.g., the function \(f_ϵ\) can be
constructed by piecewise linear function). Then \(\int
   f_ϵ\,d\mu_n\to\int f_ϵ\,d\mu\) implies \(\limsup \mu_n((-\infty,x])
   \leq \mu((-\infty,x+ϵ])\). Similarly, there is \(\mu((-\infty, x-ϵ])
   \leq \liminf \mu_n((-\infty,x])\). Then
\(\mu_nu((-\infty,x])\to\mu((-\infty,x])\) when \(\mu(\{x\})=0\).</li>

For a given probability measure \(\mu\) on the real line, the
function \(F(x):=\mu((-\infty,x])\) is nondecreasing, right-continuous,
and satisfies \(F(-\infty)=0\) and \(F(\infty)=1\), and thus is a
distribution function. Conversely, for a given distribution function
\(F\), let \(q:(0,1)\to\mathbb{R}\) be the quantile function of \(F\): \(q(u)
= \inf\{x: u\leq F(x)\}\). Then \(q(u) \leq x\) if and only if \(u \leq
F(x)\). Hence, the random variable \(q\) has the distribution \(F\) and
induces a probability measure \(\mu\). See also <a href="../2024-02-13-QuantileFunction/notes.html">this post</a> for a brief
discussion on quantile functions.
