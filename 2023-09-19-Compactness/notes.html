<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c2d47e">
<p>
<i>Proof to <a href="#orgf2bc98f">Theorem 8.5</a>.</i>
Assume \(K\) is closed and \(X\) is compact, then any open cover
of \(K\) would form an open cover of \(X\) if augmented by \(K^\mathsf{c}\).
This implies that a finite subcover of \(K\) exists.
</p>

<p>
Assume \(K\) is compact and \(X\) is Hausdorff. Pick any \(p\in
K^\mathsf{c}\).  For any \(q \in K\), there exists a neighborhood \(V_q\)
of \(q\) and a neighborhood \(W_q\) of \(p\) such that \(V_q \cap W_q =
\emptyset\). By the compactness of \(K\), there exists finite many \(q_i\)
such that \(\bigcup_{i=1}^n V_{q_i}\supset K\).  This implies that
\(\bigcap_{i=1}^n W_{q_i}\subset K^\mathsf{c}\) is a neighborhood of
\(p\). Hence, \(p\) is an interior point of \(K^\mathsf{c}\).
</p>

<p>
Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof to <a href="#org9891839">Theorem 8.11</a>.</i>
</p>

<p>
Compact \(\Rightarrow\) countably compact. Obviously.
</p>

<p>
Sequentially compact \(\Rightarrow\) countably compact.
If not, there exists a countable open cover
\((V_i)_{i=0}^\infty\)
of \(X\) which has no finite subcover.
Let \(x_k\in\bigl(\bigcup_{i=0}^k V_i\bigr)^\mathsf{c}\).
Clearly, the sequence \((x_k)\) has no convergent subsequence.
This contradicts with the hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
Countably compact \(\Rightarrow\) pseudocompact.
For any real-valued continuous function \(f:X\to\mathbb{R}\),
\((f^{-1}(-n,n))_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is a countable open cover of \(X\),
and thus has a finite subcover. WLOG, assume the finite subcover
is \((f^{-1}(-n,n))_{n=1}^{M}\). Clearly, \(f\) is bounded by \(M\).
</p>

<p>
Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof to <a href="#org52049be">Lemma 8.12</a>.</i>
First, we prove that \(X\) <span class="underline">is countably compact if and only if every sequence
has a cluster point</span>. The <i>if</i> part has been proved in Theorem 8.11. To prove
the <i>only if</i> part, assume \(X\) be countably compact and \((x_n)\) is a sequence
with no cluster point. Let \(T_n\) be the tail set of \((x_n)\):
\[T_n:=\{x_k\mid k\geq n\}.\]
Let \(\overline{T}_n\) be the closure of \(T_n\). Since \(X\) is countably compact,
the countable family of closed sets \(\{\overline{T}_n \mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}\)
must have
\[\bigcap_{n=0}^\infty\overline{T}_n\neq\emptyset.\]
Pick \(x\in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty\overline{T}_n\).
For any \(n\), there is \(x\in \overline{T}_n\).
Hence, for any neighborhood \(N_x\) of \(x\), there is \(N_x\cap T_n\neq\emptyset\).
Recalling the definition of \(T_n\), we conclude that \(x\) is a cluster point
of \((x_n)\). However, this contradicts with the hypothesis that \((x_n)\) has
no cluster point. We finish the <i>only if</i> part.
</p>

<p>
Then we prove this lemma.
Let \(X\) be countably compact and first countable.
For any sequence \((x_n)\), it has a cluster point \(x\).
There must exist a subsequence of \((x_n)\) which converges to \(x\).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let \((B_k)\) be a countable shrinking neighborhood base at \(x\).
Since \((x_n)\) is frequently in \(B_1\), we can pick \(n_1\) so that \(x_{n_1}\in B_1\).
Since \((x_n)\) is frequently in \(B_2\), we can pick \(n_2 > n_1\) so that \(x_{n_2}\in B_2\).
Continue inductively: having chosen \(n_1 < n_2 < \cdots < n_k\) so that
\(x_{n_k}\in U_k \subset U_{k-1} \subset \cdots U_1\), we can then choose \(n_{k+1} > n_k\)
so that \(x_{n_{k+1}}\in U_{k+1}\subset U_k\). Clearly, \((x_{n_k})_{k=1}^\infty\) converges
to \(x\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
In conclusion, if \(X\) is countably compact, then every sequence has a cluster point.
Since \(X\) is first countable, we conclude that every sequence has a convergent
subsequence.
</p>

<p>
Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof to <a href="#orgb017007">Lemma 8.16</a>.</i>
Let \((X,d)\) be a totally bounded pseudometric space.
</p>

<p>
First, we prove that <span class="underline">a totally bounded pseudometric space is
separable</span>. For each \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), there exists finite many points
\(x^{(n)}_1,x^{(n)}_2,\ldots x^{(n)}_{k_n}\) such that \(X\) can be
covered by \(\frac{1}{n}\)-balls centered at these points.  We claim
that \[ E:=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \{x^{(n)}_i\mid 1\leq i\leq k_n\} \]
is a dense subset of \(X\).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For any \(x\in X\) and arbitrary small \(\epsilon > 0\),
we can find \(x^{(n)}_i\in E\) such that \(d( x^{(n)}_i, x ) < \epsilon\).
This is done by choosing \(n > \frac{1}{\epsilon}\) and \(i=1\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then, we prove that <span class="underline">a separable pseudometric space is second countable</span>.
Let \(D=\{x_k\mid x\in\mathbb{N}\}\) be a dense subset of \(X\).
We claim that
\[
\mathcal{O} := \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \{B_{\frac{1}{n}}(x_k)\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}
\]
is a countable topological base.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For any \(x\in V\in\mathcal{T}_d\), there exists some \(\epsilon > 0\)
such that \(B_\epsilon(x)\subset V\). As \(D\) is dense in \(X\), there is
\(x_k\in D\) such that \(d(x_k, x) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}\). Choose \(n\)
such that \(\frac{1}{n} < \frac{\epsilon}{2}\), we have
\(B_{\frac{1}{n}}(x_k)\subset B_\epsilon(x)\subset V\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Finally, we prove that <span class="underline">a second countable pseudometric space is Lindelöf</span>.
Let \(\mathcal{B}\) be a countable base of \(\mathcal{T}\), and let \(\mathcal{U}\)
be an arbitrary open cover of \(X\). For any \(x\in X\),
there exists \(U_x\in\mathcal{U}\) such that \(x\in U_x\).
Since \(\mathcal{B}\) is a base, for each \(x\), there exists a \(B_x\in\mathcal{B}\)
such that \(x\in B_x\subset U_x\). Therefore,
\[
\mathcal{V}:=\bigcup_{x\in X}B_x
\]
forms an open cover of \(X\). However, \(\mathcal{V}\subset\mathcal{B}\) must be
countable. Hence, \(\mathcal{V}\) can be represented as
\[
\mathcal{V}:=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty B_{x_i}.
\]
We conclude that \(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty U_{x_i}\) is a countable subcover.
</p>

<p>
Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof to <a href="#orge3f6358">Theorem 8.17</a>.</i>
Based on Theorem 8.11, we need only to prove the following implications.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Countably compactness implies sequentially compactness</dt><dd>As any pseudometric space is first countable,
then countably compactness implies sequentially compactness by
Lemma 8.12.</dd>
<dt>Countably compactness implies compactness</dt><dd><p>
By Lemma 8.16, any totally bounded pseudometric space is Lindelöf.
Hence, it is sufficient to prove that a countably pseudometric space
is totally bounded.
</p>

<p>
If a countably compact pseudometric space is not totally bounded,
then there exists \(\epsilon > 0\) such that \(X\) cannot be covered
by finite many \(\epsilon\)-balls. Obviously, \(X\) is nonempty.
Pick \(x_1 \in X\). As \(\{B_\epsilon(x_1)\}\) cannot cover \(X\),
we can pick \(x_2\in X\) such that \(d(x_2,x_1) \geq \epsilon\).
Again, as \(\{B_\epsilon(x_1), B_\epsilon(x_2)\}\) cannot cover \(X\),
we can pick \(x_3\in X\) such that \(d(x_3,x_1) \geq \epsilon\)
and \(d(x_3,x_2)\geq \epsilon\). Continue inductively,
we may construct a sequence \((x_n)\) such that \(d(x_i,x_j) \geq \epsilon\)
for each \(i\neq j\). Clearly, this sequence has no convergent subsequence.
However, since we have proved that
<i>countably compactness implies sequentially compactness</i>, \((x_n)\) must have a
convergent subsequence, leading to a contradiction.
</p></dd>
<dt>Pseudocompactness implies countably compactness</dt><dd>Assume \(X\) is pseudocompact but is not countably compact.
As \(X\) is not countably compact, there exists a sequence \((x_n)\) with
no cluster point.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>STEP I. Ensure \(d(x_n,x_m) > 0\) for all \(n\neq m\). If not, we may
pick a subsequence \((x_{a_k})\) such that \(d(x_{a_n},x_{a_m}) > 0\)
for all \(n\neq m\).

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The subsequence is constructed by observing
the following fact: /for any \(n\), the set \[ E_n:= \{m > n \mid
      d(x_m,x_n) =0\} \] must be finite. Otherwise, there would be
convergent subsequence, and contradicts with the assumption that
\((x_n)\) has no cluster point.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>STEP II. Construct a sequence of open sets \((U_n)_{n=1}^\infty\)
such that 1) \(x_n\in U_n\); 2) \(U_i\cap U_j=\emptyset\) if \(i\neq
    j\); 3) \(\mathrm{diam}\,U_n\to 0\).

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For any \(x_m\), there exists an open ball \(B_{\delta_m}(x_m)\)
containing only finte many \(x_n\)'s (since \(x_m\) is not a cluster
point of \((x_n)\)). Because \(d(x_n,x_m) > 0\) for all \(n\neq m\),
the \(\delta_m\) may be shrunk such that \(B_{\delta_m}(x_m)\)
contains no other \(x_n\)'s except \(x_m\). In other words,
\[
      d(x_m, x_n) \geq \delta_m,\qquad\forall n\neq m.
      \]
Let \(\epsilon_m=\min(\delta_m/3, \frac{1}{m})\). Then we claim
that \(U_n=B_{\epsilon_n}(x_n)\) forms the desired sequence of
open sets. Clearly, \(x_n\in U_n\) and
\(\operatorname{diam}U_n\to0\). To see that \(U_n\cap
      U_m=\emptyset\) if \(n\neq m\), we need only to note that
\(\epsilon_n + \epsilon_m \leq \delta_n/3 + \delta_m/3 <
      d(x_n,x_m)\).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>STEP III. Show \(f_n(x)=n\frac{d(x_n,U_n^\mathsf{c})}{d(x_n,U_n^\mathsf{c})}\)
and \(f=\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n\) are well defined.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As \(x_n\not\in U_n^\mathsf{c}\) and \(U_n^\mathsf{c}\) is closed,
the distance \(d(x_n,U_n^\mathsf{c}\) cannot be 0. Moreover,
\(d(x,U_n^\mathsf{c}\neq 0\) if and only \(x\in U_n\). Hence,
for any \(x\), there exists at most one \(f_n\) such that
\(f_n(x)\neq 0\). Therefore, \(f=\sum_n f_n\) is finite at any
\(x\).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>STEP IV. Prove that \(f\) is an unbounded continuous function.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Since \(f(x_n)=f_n(x_n)=n\), we have \(f\) is unbounded. To prove
\(f\) is continuous, we first note that \(f_n\) is continuous.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If \(d\) is a metric on \(X\) and \(E\) is a subset of \(X\), then
for any \(x,y\in X\), there is
\[
        d(x,E) \leq d(y,E) + d(x,y).
        \]
Therefore, \(d(\cdot,E)\) must be continuous.
(If \(d(x_n,x)\to0\), then \(|d(x_n,E)-d(x,E)|\leq d(x_n,x)\to0\).)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then we prove that for any \(a\in X\), there exists a open set
\(V_a\) such that \(f|_{V_a}=\sum_{n=1}^Nf_n\) for some \(N\).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If \(d(a,x_n)=0\) for some \(n\), then \(V_a\) can be set to \(U_n\) and
\(N=n\).</li>

<li>Suppose \(d(a,x_n)>0\) for all \(n\). Since \(a\) is not a cluster
point of \(x_n\), there exists an open ball \(B_\delta(a)\)
containing no \(x_n\). In other words,
\[
        d(a,x_n) \geq \delta,\qquad\forall n.
        \]
Let \(V_a=B_{\delta/2}(a)\). Then for any \(x\in V_a\),
\[
        d(x,x_n) \geq d(a,x_n) - d(a,x) \geq \delta/2,\qquad\forall n.
        \]
Recalling that \(\operatorname{diam}U_n\to0\),
there must exist \(N\) such that for all \(n\geq N\),
\(\operatorname{diam}U_n < \delta/2\).
Therefore, for any \(x\in V_a\), we have \(x\not\in U_n\) for all
\(n\geq N\). In otherwords, \(f_n(x)=0\) for all \(n\geq N\) if
\(x\in V_a\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore, \(f\) is continous at any point \(a\).
