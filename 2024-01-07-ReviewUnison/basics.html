<a href="https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison">Unison</a> is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and
directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then
brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This review is a short summary of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcpierce00/unison/documentation/unison-manual.pdf">the official manual</a>.
Please use version 2.52 or newer to avoid version interoperability issues.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb896952">
<p>
Unison can be used with either of two user interfaces: a textual interface and a graphical interface.
</p>

<p>
Let's consider a simple scenario and see how to synchronize two directories on a single machine.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="0">install Unison. Basically, we need only two executable binary files, <code>unison</code> and <code>unison-gui</code>,
downloaded from the proper release tarball in <a href="https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison">its github repository</a>.</li>

<li><p>
Set up a <code>work</code> directory and a <code>mirror</code> direcotry for our illustration
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">    mkdir work
    touch work/a work/b
    mkdir work/d
    touch work/d/f
    cp -r work mirror
</pre>
</div></li>

<li>Try synchronizing <code>work</code> and <code>mirror</code>. Since they are identical, synchronizing them won’t propagate
any changes, but Unison will remember the current state of both directories so that it will be able to tell
next time what has changed by typing <code>unison work mirror</code>.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>textual interface:</i> you should see a message notifying you that all the files are actually equal and then get returned to
the command line, and you may also get a warning message for creating <i>archives</i> (the private data structure used by Unison)
as this is the first run of Unison.</li>

<li><i>graphical interface:</i> You should get a big empty window with a message at the bottom notifying you <i>everything is up-to-date</i>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
Make some changes in <code>work</code> and <code>mirror</code>
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">    rm work/a
    <span style="color: #657b83; font-weight: bold;">echo</span> <span style="color: #2aa198;">"Hello"</span> &gt; work/b
    <span style="color: #657b83; font-weight: bold;">echo</span> <span style="color: #2aa198;">"Hello"</span> &gt; mirror/b
    date &gt; mirror/c
    <span style="color: #657b83; font-weight: bold;">echo</span> <span style="color: #2aa198;">"Hi there"</span> &gt; work/d/h
    <span style="color: #657b83; font-weight: bold;">echo</span> <span style="color: #2aa198;">"Hello there"</span> &gt; mirror/d/h
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Try synchronizing <code>work</code> and <code>mirror</code> again by typing <code>unison work mirror</code>.
</p>

<p>
Let us elaborate the behaviors of the textual interface in this case.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="0">Unison will display <i>only</i> the files that are different and ask for actions one by one.
If a file has been changed in the same way and remain identical in both directories,
Unison will simply note the file is up-to-date and nothing will be shown. So we expect three
changes to be decided: the absent file of <code>a</code> in <code>work</code>, the new file <code>c</code> in <code>mirror</code>
and the conflicting changes on <code>d/h</code>.</li>

<li><p>
Unison will notify the creation of <code>c</code> in <code>mirror</code> and prompt a line like
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org971a46a">
         &lt;--- new file   c  [f]
</pre>

<p>
We can follow Unison’s recommendation, press <code>f</code> or <code>[ENTER]</code> at the prompt.
Or we can simply ignore this file and leave both replicas alone by pressing <code>/</code>.
Pressing <code>?</code> for a list of possible responses and their meanings.
See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64587602/how-does-one-use-the-matching-condition-commands-for-the-unison-cli">this question</a> for explanation on the key <code>L</code> and matching conditions.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Similarly, Unison will notify the delete of <code>a</code> in work and prompt a line like
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgc22d174">
deleted  ---&gt;            a  [f]
</pre></li>

<li><p>
For conflicting changes on <code>d/h</code>, Unison will prompt a line like
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd097e74">
new file &lt;-?-&gt; new file   d/h  []
</pre></li>

<li><p>
Suppose we skip the file <code>d/h</code> and accept changes on file <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>, Unison
will briefly summarize the actions it is supposed to do and asks for
confirmation
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd200948">
2 items will be synced, 1 skipped
0 B to be synced from work to mirror
32 B to be synced from mirror to work

Proceed with propagating updates? []
</pre></li>

<li>Finally, if we confirm then Unison will apply changes and output logs of the process.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The usage of the graphical interface is similar. The main window shows all the files that have been modified.
To override a default action (or to select an action in the case when there is no default), first select the file
by clicking on its name, then press the desired action key metioned before.
When you are satisfied with the propagation of changes as shown in the main window,
click the <i>Go</i> button to set them in motion.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Below is a short summary of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcpierce00/unison/documentation/unison-manual.pdf">the official manual</a>.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Roots.</i> A replica’s root tells Unison where to find a set of files to be synchronized, either on the local machine or on
a remote host. The pattern of the root is <code>[protocol:]//[user@][host][:port][path]</code>.
When <code>path</code> is given without any protocol prefix, the protocol is assumed to be <code>file</code>.
Other possible protocol arguments include <code>ssh</code> and <code>socket</code>.
If <code>path</code> is a relative path, then it actually specifies a local root relative to the directory where Unison is started.</li>

<li><i>Paths.</i> A <i>path</i> refers to a point within a set of files being synchronized; it is specified relative to the root of the
replica. Formally, a path is just a sequence of names, separated by <code>/</code>.
The empty path (i.e., the empty sequence of names) denotes the whole replica.
Unison displays the empty path as <code>[root]</code>.</li>

<li><i>Descendants.</i>   If <code>p</code> is a path and <code>q</code> is a path beginning with <code>p</code>, then <code>q</code> is said to be a <i>descendant</i> of <code>p</code>.
Thus, each path is also a descendant of itself.</li>

<li><p>
<i>Contents.</i> The <i>contents</i> of a path <code>p</code> in a particular replica could be a file, a directory, a symbolic link, or absent (if p
does not refer to anything at all in that replica). More specifically:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If <code>p</code> refers to an ordinary file, then the contents of p are the actual contents of this file (a string of
bytes) plus the current permission bits of the file.</li>

<li>If <code>p</code> refers to a symbolic link, then the contents of <code>p</code> are just the string specifying where the link points.</li>

<li>If <code>p</code> refers to a directory, then the contents of p are just the token <i>DIRECTORY</i> plus the current
permission bits of the directory.</li>

<li>If <code>p</code> does not refer to anything in this replica, then the contents of <code>p</code> are the token <i>ABSENT</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Unison keeps a record (named <i>archives</i>) of the contents of each path after each successful synchronization
of that path (i.e., it remembers the contents at the last moment when they were the same in the two replicas).
</p></li>

<li><i>Update.</i> A path is <i>updated</i> (in some replica) if its current contents are different from its contents the
last time it was successfully synchronized.</li>

<li><i>Conflicts.</i> A path is said to be <i>conflicting</i> if the following conditions <i>all</i> hold:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>it has been updated in one replica,</li>

<li>any of its descendants has been updated in the other replica,</li>

<li>its contents in the two replicas are not identical.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><i>Reconciliation.</i> Unison operates in several distinct stages:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>On each host, it compares its archive file (which records the state of each path in the replica when it
was last synchronized) with the current contents of the replica, to determine which paths have been updated.</li>

<li>It checks for <i>false conflicts</i>  — paths that have been updated on both replicas, but whose current
values are identical. These paths are silently marked as synchronized in the archive files in both replicas.</li>

<li>It displays all the updated paths to the user. For updates that do not conflict, it suggests a default
action (propagating the new contents from the updated replica to the other). Conflicting updates are
just displayed. The user is given an opportunity to examine the current state of affairs, change the
default actions for nonconflicting updates, and choose actions for conflicting updates.</li>

<li>It performs the selected actions, one at a time. Each action is performed by first transferring the new
contents to a temporary file on the receiving host, then atomically moving them into place.</li>

<li>It updates its archive files to reflect the new state of the replicas.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>
<i>Invariants.</i> Unison is careful to protect both its internal state and the state of the replicas at every point in this
process. Specifically, the following guarantees are enforced:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>At every moment, each path in each replica has either

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>its original contents (i.e., no change at all has been made to this path), or</li>

<li>its correct final contents (i.e., the value that the user expected to be propagated from the other replica).</li>
</ol></li>

<li>At every moment, the information stored on disk about Unison’s private state can be either

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>unchanged, or</li>
<li>updated to reflect those paths that have been successfully synchronized.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>
If Unison gets interrupted during ensuring those guarantees, some manual cleanup may be required.
In this case, a file called DANGER.README will be left in the <code>.unison</code> directory,
containing information about the operation that was interrupted.
The next time you try to run Unison, it will notice this file and warn you about it.
</p>

<p>
If Unison is interrupted, it may sometimes leave temporary working files (with suffix <code>.tmp</code>) in the replicas.
It is safe to delete these files. Also, if the backups flag is set, Unison will leave around old versions of files
that it overwrites, with names like <code>file.0.unison.bak</code>. These can be deleted safely when they are no longer wanted.
</p>

<p>
If Unison finds that its archive files have been deleted (or that the archive format has changed and they
cannot be read, or that they don’t exist because this is the first run of Unison on these particular roots),
it takes a conservative approach: it behaves as though the replicas had both been completely empty at the
point of the last synchronization. Thus, It is also safe to delete those archive files on both replicas.
The next time Unison runs, it will assume that all the files it sees in the replicas are new.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf145269">
<p>
Once you are comfortable with the basic operation of Unison, you may find yourself wanting to use it
regularly to synchronize your commonly used files. There are several possible ways of going about this:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Synchronize your whole home directory, using the <i>Ignore facility</i> to
avoid synchronizing particular directories and files.</li>

<li>Synchronize your whole home directory, but tell Unison to synchronize only some of
the files and subdirectories within it. This can be accomplished by specifying the <code>-path</code>
arguments in your <i>profile</i>.</li>

<li>Create another directory called <code>shared</code> (or <code>current</code>, or whatever) on each host,
and put all the files you want to synchronize into this directory. Tell Unison to synchronize <code>shared</code>
among different hosts.</li>

<li>Create another directory called <code>shared</code> (or <code>current</code>, or whatever) on each host,
and put <i>links</i> to all the files you want to synchronize into this directory. Use the <code>follow</code> preference
to make Unison treat these links as transparent.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Unison is designed for synchronizing pairs of replicas. However, it is possible to use it to keep larger groups
of machines in sync by performing multiple pairwise synchronizations.
If you need to do this, the most reliable way to set things up is to organize the machines into a <i>star topology</i>
with one machine designated as the <i>hub</i> and the rest as <i>spokes</i> and with each spoke machine
synchronizing only with the hub.

<div id="outline-container-orgd353dec" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd353dec"><a href="#orgd353dec">Caveats and Shortcomings</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd353dec">
<p>
Here are some things to be careful of when using Unison.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Unison cannot understand rename, and sees it as a delete and a separate create.</li>

<li><p>
You need to be very <i>CAREFUL</i> when renaming directories containing <code>ignored</code> files.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose Unison is synchronizing directory <code>A</code> between the two machines called the <i>local</i>
and the <i>remote</i> machine; suppose directory <code>A</code> contains a subdirectory <code>D</code>; and suppose <code>D</code> on the
local machine contains a file or subdirectory <code>P</code> that matches an ignore directive in the profile used to
synchronize. Thus path <code>A/D/P</code> exists on the local machine but not on the remote machine.
</p>

<p>
If <code>D</code> is renamed to <code>Dnew</code> on the remote machine, and this change is propagated to the local machine, all
such files or subdirectories <code>P</code> will be deleted. This is because Unison sees the rename as a delete and
a separate create: it deletes the old directory (including the ignored files) and creates a new one (not
including the ignored files, since they are completely invisible to it).
</p>

<p>
<i>Solution.</i> Keep in mind that Unison may deleted ignored paths
without warning. Create backups for those paths separately.
</p></li>

<li><p>
It could be very <i>DANGEROUS</i> to use Unison with removable media
such as USB drives unless you are careful.
</p>

<p>
If you synchronize a directory that is stored on removable media
when the media is not present, it will look to Unison as though
the whole directory has been deleted, and it will proceed to
delete the directory from the other replica!
</p>

<p>
<i>Solution.</i> Running Unison with <code>-confirmbigdel</code> option will ask
about whole-replica (or path) deletes. Running Unison with
<code>-nodeletion</code> or similar options will prevent Unison from
performing any file deletion on a specified root.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Archives are created based on names of roots (and other informations), meaning that renaming roots
results Unison think it never sync these before.
</p>

<p>
For example, assume you have run Unison to sync <code>work</code> and <code>mirror</code>
before, and <code>mirror</code> were renamed to <code>backup</code> and some files are
changed. Now, running <code>unison work backup</code> will create new
archives and ask you to resolve conflicts.  In this case, you
may find the option <code>-prefer backup</code> be useful, which effectively
choose files in <code>backup</code> to resolve possible conflicts.
</p></li>

<li>If you want to run Unison continuously as a crontab task, then you have to ensure the same
script will not be called unless its previous call has finished. Otherwise there will be two
running Unison instance caring about same targets and interfere each other. For example,
it could be that a sync of big files takes more than 10 minutes, which would create problems
if you have set every 10 minutes a new sync would be started.</li>

<li>The graphical user interface is single-threaded. This means that if Unison is performing some long-
running operation, the display will not be repainted until it finishes. We recommend not trying to do
anything with the user interface while Unison is in the middle of detecting changes or propagating files.</li>
