Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor
which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and
Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and
Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and
runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).

Here is the official documentation [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs][VS Code - Get Started]]

See also [[https://adamtheautomator.com/visual-studio-code-tutorial/][The Visual Studio Code Tutorial Worth Learning]] for a brief
introduction to VS Code.

** 1. Interface
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interface
   :END:

The UI is divided into five areas:

- Editor - The main area to edit your files. You can open as many
  editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.

- Side Bar - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you
  while working on your project.

- Status Bar - Information about the opened project and the files you
  edit.

- Activity Bar - Located on the far left-hand side, this lets you switch
  between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators,
  like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled.

- Panels - You can display different panels below the editor region for
  output or debug information, errors and warnings, or an integrated
  terminal. Panel can also be moved to the right for more vertical
  space.

** 2. Command Palette
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: command-palette
   :END:

The Command Palette in VS Code is a menu that */provides access to all
functionality within VS Code and any installed extensions/*. It can be
accessed via the View menu or by using the =Ctrl-Shift-P= shortcut. The
Command Palette is /a single location for managing tasks, settings,
snippets, and more/, making it a useful tool for easy and efficient
navigation within VS Code.

** 3. Customization
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: customization
   :END:

There are many things you can do to customize VS Code.

- Change your theme =>Preferences: Color Theme=

  #+END_QUOTE

- Tune your settings =>Preferences: Open Settings (UI)=

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
You can scope the settings that you only want for specific languages
by the language identifier, see [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_language-specific-settings][Language specific settings]].
  #+END_QUOTE

- Create snippets

- Install extensions

To manage settings, open the Command Palette with =Ctrl-Shift-P=. Type
"settings" and choose =Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)= or
=Preferences: Open Settings (UI)=

Depending on your platform, the user settings file is located here:

- Windows =%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json=
- macOS =$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json=
- Linux =$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json=

** 4. Extensions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: extensions
   :END:

One of the most important features of VS Code is its extensions. An
extension is a small package you can load into VS Code that makes
working with various resources easier.

Extensions are installed in a per user extensions folder. Depending on
your platform, the location is in the following folder:

- Windows =%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions=
- macOS =~/.vscode/extensions=
- Linux =~/.vscode/extensions=

** 5. Snippets
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: snippets
   :END:

Snippets allow you to type a few characters in a code editor tab that
quickly expands to whatever you need. Each snippet is a single JSON
element that matches a particular syntax.

Snippets exist by language or extension and are stored in JSON files.
For example, you can have a set of PowerShell, ARM template, Python, C#,
and Javascript snippets installed simultaneously.

You can find snippets by opening up the command palette with
=Ctrl-Shift-P=, typing "snippets" and hitting Enter.

See [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets][Snippets in Visual Studio Code]] for more details.
